# Light Stage (Light Dependent Stage)

## Light abosorbed

- Chloroplasts have many pigments, including chlorophyll
- All absorb different wavelengths of light

## Light energy is transferred to electrons

- Pigments arranged in clusters
- Clusters have a strategically-placed chlorophyll molecule (called reaction centre chlorophyll) and an electron acceptor
- Light is captured by all pigments
- Energy is passed along to the specific chlorophyll beside the electron acceptor
- When the energy reaches the electron accpetor, it energises (excites) an electron
- It can go on 2 different pathways **Pathway 1** and **Pathway 2**

## Pathway 1

- Electrons leave the electron accpetor and go along a series of other electron acceptors.
- They lose energy as they get passed from acceptor to acceptor
- Return to the original electron accpetor (recycled)
- Their energy is used in the following reaction:
  $$
  ADP + energy + P \longrightarrow ATP + water
  $$

* Since the elctrons are recycled, pathway 1 is said to be **cyclic**
* ATP synthesis is also **cyclic electron flow**

## Pathway 2

- Occurs when 2 electrons leave the electron accpetor
- Get passed along a series of electron acceptors
- They don't return to chlorophyll
- They get passed along in the same way as in Pathway 1
- 2 Electrons combine with NADP+ to create NADP-
  $$ NADP^+ + 2e^- \longrightarrow NADP^-$$
- The chlorophyll needs new electrons (because the two electrons don't return)
- Gains electrons by splitting water (**photolysis**)
- **Photolysis** is the splitting of water by light
  $$
  2H_2O \longrightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^- + O_2
  $$
- The protons ($H^+$) formed in **photolysis** are attracted to NADP-
  $$ NADP^- + H^+ \longrightarrow NADPH$$

### End Products of Light Stage

1. ATP
2. NADPH - Used in dark stage
3. Oxygen

# Dark Stage

### Overview

- The dark stage is controlled by enzymes
  - Therefore controlled by temperature

### Steps Involved

- Carbon dioxide enters the chloroplast
- NADPH breaks down to supply electrons and H+ \* NADP+ is used in the light stage
  $$
  NAPDH \longrightarrow NADP^+ + 2\ electrons + H^+
  $$
- Energy is supplied by the breakdown of ATP

  $$
  ATP + Water \longrightarrow ADP + P + energy
  $$

- Carbon dioxide gets turned into Glucose
