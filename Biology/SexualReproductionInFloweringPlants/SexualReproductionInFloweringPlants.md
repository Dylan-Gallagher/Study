# Sexual Reproduction In Flowering Plants

## Asexual and Sexual Reproduction

### Asexual

- Only involves one parent
- Doesn't require meiosis
- Does not involve sex cells
- Offspring genetically identical

### Sexual Reproduction

- Involves the union of two sex cells (gametes)
- Two parents
- Meiosis is essential for formation of gametes
- Gametes fuse to form a zygote
- Offspring show **variations**
  - Sexual reproduction is better than Asexual
    - Variations result in a stronger species

## Structures and functions of parts of a flower

  - Consists of:
    - Thin stalk (**filament**)
